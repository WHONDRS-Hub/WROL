The USGS does not have a parameter code for ammonium that is appropriate, so 00000 is used as a placeholder to keep column name formats consistent. For each sampling event (e.g. SPS_005_ION), the NPOC values of each of the three biological replicates (e.g. SPS_005_ION-1; SPS_005_ION-2; SPS_005_ION-3) are averaged. Any replicate values that were identified as an outlier or were above/below the limit of detection are not included in the mean. Outliers were identified using distance based outlier detection. If the set of replicates had a coefficient of variation of 30 percent or higher, the outlier was identified by calculating the distance between each of the replicates.

Any replicate values that were identified as an outlier or were above/below the limit of detection are not included in the mean. Outliers were identified using distance based outlier detection.
