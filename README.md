## Summary
This data package is associated with the publication “Riverine dissolved organic matter transformations increase with watershed area, water residence time, and Damköhler numbers in nested watersheds” submitted to Biogeochemistry by Ryan et al., 2024 (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10533-024-01169-5).  

This study aims to investigate fundamental and transferable drivers of dissolved organic matter (DOM) diversity across five nested watersheds within the contiguous United States. DOM diversity was explored using ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS). The samples and the unprocessed FTICR-MS data used in this study are publicly available on the Environmental System Science Data Infrastructure for a Virtual Ecosystem (ESS-DIVE) data repository (see DOIs below). The data for the Willamette, Gunnison, Connecticut, and Deschutes basins were collected as part of a collaboration between the Watershed Rules of Life (WROL) project and Worldwide Hydrobiogeochemistry Observation Network for Dynamic River Systems (WHONDRS). The data for the Yakima River basin (YRB) was collected by the PNNL River Corridor SFA. The raw, unprocessed FTICR-MS data with additional (meta)data can be found at [doi:10.15485/1895159](https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/view/doi:10.15485/1895159) for WROL samples and [doi:10.15485/1898912](https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/view/doi:10.15485/1898912) for YRB samples. This data package contains the processed data used in the associated manuscript. This package also contains ancillary geospatial, hydrological, and geochemical information that supports the interpretation of the FTICR-MS data within Ryan et al., 2024.
